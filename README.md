# Udacity Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree Projects

#### 1. AIND-Isolation
- Implementation of an adversarial search agent to play the game "Isolation". Isolation is a deterministic, two-player game of perfect information in which the players alternate turns moving a single piece from one cell to another on a board. Whenever either player occupies a cell, that cell becomes blocked for the remainder of the game. The first player with no remaining legal moves loses, and the opponent is declared the winner.
- This project has implementations of Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning
#### 2. Diagonal Sudoku Solver
- This project uses constraint propagation and depth first search to solve a diagonal sudoku puzzle
- The sudoku solver can be vizualized using pygame
#### 3. Pacman
- This project implements Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, Uniform Cost Search and A* Search.
- The project also includes heuristics for finding food dots in a pacman maze
- To play regular pacman, run `python pacman.py` in the project root
#### 4. Simulated Annealing
- This short lab project uses simulated annealing to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem
#### 5. Constraint Satisfaction
- This short lab project uses constraint propagation to solve the 8 Queens problem
